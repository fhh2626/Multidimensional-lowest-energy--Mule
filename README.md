# Multidimensional-lowest-energy--Mule
MULE can find the lowest-(free)-energy pathway on a multidimensional landscape using the Dijkstra algorithm. 

MULE is under maintenance. It is not updated frequently just because it is stable. Feel free to report any bugs. We use it everyday!

## Features

Mathmetically rigorous;  
Applicable to any dimension;  
Compatible to periodic CVs;  
Adaptable to user-defined restraints (One can use the A* algorithm or let the pathway pass by or bypass a region.);

## Installation

Simply compile mule.cpp. Windows users can use mule.exe inside the tutorial directly.

## Manuals

See the tutorial folder.  
A Chinese introduction of MULE can be found [here](http://bbs.keinsci.com/thread-17796-1-1.html).
